To start building a scheduler app, it's generally recommended to begin with the core functionality and gradually expand from there. Here's a suggested order to start developing the key components of your app:

1. **Database Design**: Begin by designing the database schema for storing user information, tasks, calendar events, and projects. Identify the relationships between different entities and create the necessary tables/models.

2. **User Authentication and Account Management**: Implement user registration, login, and authentication functionality. This will allow users to create accounts, log in securely, and manage their profile information.

3. **Task Management**: Focus on developing the functionality to create, view, update, and delete tasks. Implement features like assigning priorities, setting due dates, and tracking task completion status.

4. **Calendar Integration**: Integrate a calendar module that allows users to view their tasks and events on a calendar interface. Implement features like adding, updating, and deleting events, as well as highlighting important dates.

5. **Collaboration and Communication**: Implement collaboration features that enable users to create and join projects, assign tasks to team members, and communicate within the app. Develop project-specific task lists, workflow management, and real-time communication channels.

6. **Roadmap Generation and AI Integration**: Integrate AI capabilities to generate task roadmaps or provide task suggestions based on user input. This could involve leveraging machine learning algorithms or rule-based systems to assist users in planning their tasks efficiently.

7. **Project Repository and CI/CD Integration**: Connect your app to a version control system like GitHub to manage project repositories and track changes. Integrate continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipelines to automate the build, test, and deployment processes.

8. **Document and Project Organization**: Implement features to organize project-related documents, files, and resources. Provide users with the ability to upload, download, and manage project-related documents within the app.

9. **Frontend Development**: Start developing the frontend components of your app, including user interfaces for task management, calendar views, collaboration features, and user profile management. Implement responsive designs and user-friendly interactions.

10. **Testing and Quality Assurance**: Conduct thorough testing of your app's functionality, including unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing. Ensure the app is reliable, secure, and performs well under various scenarios.

11. **Deployment and Maintenance**: Deploy your app to a hosting platform, configure production environments, and handle any necessary server configurations. Regularly maintain and update your app to address bugs, add new features, and improve performance.

Remember to break down each component into smaller tasks and focus on one feature at a time. This approach will help you manage the development process effectively and ensure that your app's core functionality is in place before expanding to more advanced features.
